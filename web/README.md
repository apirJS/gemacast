# Gemacast website

Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS website for product information and
release downloads. The mobile React application is in
[`gemacast-mobile/`](../gemacast-mobile/).

## Commands

Run from `web/` with Bun and Node.js `^22.18.0` or `>=24.12.0`, as specified in
[package.json](package.json).

| Command | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| `bun install --frozen-lockfile` | Install locked dependencies |
| `bun run dev` | Start the Vite development server |
| `bun run type-check` | Check Vue and TypeScript types |
| `bun run lint` | Run Oxlint and ESLint with automatic fixes |

Vitest is configured with jsdom; no website test files are currently present.
The repository [CI frontend job](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) checks the mobile
application, not this website.
